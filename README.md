# Local-Group-Satellites
Repository for reproducing plots within the Encyclopaedia of Astrophysics chapter on Local Group Satellites. The code for reproducing all plots is provided as a python notebook. It uses the local_volume_database from Andrew Pace (https://github.com/apace7/local_volume_database) as its data source.
